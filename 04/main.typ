    a general optimal control problem for a nonlinear discrete-time system over

    a linear and time invariant (LTI) discrete-time system and a quadratic cost

    the state equation, co-state equation and stationarity equation. Show and
    discuss also two types of boundary conditions.])[]

    fixed final state LQ-optimal control problem over a finite horizon, that is,
    you do not have to give formulas but you should be able to state among the

    is a necessary condition.])[]


    #question(name: [Give a qualitative characterization of the solution to the
    free final state LQ-optimal control problem over a finite horizon, that is,
    you do not have to give formulas but you should be able to state among the
    highlights that the control is closed-loop, namely, a time-varying linear
    state feedback and that the feedback gains can be computed by solving a
    difference Riccati equation.])[]


    #question(name: [Discuss how solution to the free final state LQ problem
    changes as the horizon is extended to infinity. Emphasize that the optimal
    solution is given by a constant linear state feedback whose gains are
    computed by solving a discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (DARE). What
    are the conditions under which a stabilizing solution is guaranteed to
    exist? What are the conditions under which it is guaranteed that there is a
    unique stabilizing solution of DARE?])[]
