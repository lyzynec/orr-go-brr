Highlight that it comes in the form of a set of differential and algebraic equations together with the boundary conditions that reflect the type of the problem.])[]


    #question(name: [Give the first-order necessary conditions for an optimal control problem on a fixed and finite time interval with a continous LTI system and a quadratic cost - so-called LQ problem. Discuss how the boundary conditions change if the final state if regarded fixed or free.])[]


    #question(name: [Characterize qualitatively the solution to the LQ-optimal control problem on a fixed and finite time interval with a fixed final state. Namely, you should emphasize that it is an open-loop control.])[]


    #question(name: [Characterize qualitatively the solution to the LQ-optimal control problem on a fixed and finite time interval with a free final state. Namely, you should emphasize that it is a time-varying state-feedback control and that the time-varying feedback gains are computed from the solution to the differential Riccati equation.])[]


    #question(name: [Explain the basic facts about LQ-optimal control on an infinite time interval with a free final state. Namely, you should explain that it comes in the form of a state feedback and that the feedback gain can be computed either as the limiting solution to the differential Riccati equation or (and this is preferrable) as a solution to Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE). The latter option brings in some issues related to existence and uniqueness of a stabilizing controller, which you should discuss.])[]
