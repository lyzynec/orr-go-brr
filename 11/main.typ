    #question(name: [Design a robust controller by H∞ norm minimization (your task is actually just to formulate the control design problem as the optimization problem, the actual numerical job of optimization can be relegated to an available numerical solver). Namely, you should master the technique of control design by minimizing the H∞ norm of mixed sensitivity function but you should also be able to formulate (and use Matlab to solve) the general H∞-optimal control problem.])[]
