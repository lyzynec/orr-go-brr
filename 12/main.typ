    #question(name: [Explain the concept of a bandwidth. Shall we define it using the sensitivity or the complementary sensitivity functions?])[]


    #question(name: [Give the two "waterbed effect" integral formulas. You do not have to remember the formulas exactly but at least the essence.])[]


    #question(name: [Give the SISO version of interpolation conditions of internal stability. Namely, assuming that the transfer function of the system vanishes at z in the right half plane of the complex plane, it must hold that S(z) = 1. Similarly, for an unstable pole p of the system, it must hold that T(p) = 1. ])[]
