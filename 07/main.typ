    #question(name: [Explain the essence of Pontryagin's principle of maximum. Give the first-order necessary conditions of optimality (for optimal control) using Pontryagin's principle (instead of the equation of stationarity).])[]


    #question(name: [GIve (a sketch of) the derivation of time-optimal control for a double integrator with bounds on the control signal - bang-bang control. Discuss the key properties of the resulting controller. Discuss also the practical issues related to implementation. What kind of heuristics could be used to compensate those issues?])[]
